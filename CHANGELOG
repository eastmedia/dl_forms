== 0.1.0 / 2008-04-08

* Include README, CHANGELOG, MIT-LICENSE
* Explicitly define dl_check_box so we can remove the hidden input that Rails 
  likes to insert. Will make default uses of validates_acceptance_of fail 
  (because form submissions will no longer include a "0" value for the 
  attribute).
