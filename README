= dl_forms - Form Helper methods for Rails apps that leverage semantic HTML
 
  http://github.com/eastmedia/dl_forms
 
* mailto:matt@eastmedia.com
 
== DESCRIPTION:

Generates form helper methods that use Dictionary List (DL) HTML tags. They
mostly just wrap Rails' default methods with DL/DT/DD tags. With the correct 
CSS they look great and are incredibly helpful for fast form-building.

These helper methods will also handle error messages at the field level. Also
looks great when styled properly.

== REQUIREMENTS:
 
* Rails >= 2.0.1
 
== INSTALL:
 
Put the dl_forms.rb file in your app/helpers directory.

In your app/helpers/application_helper.rb:
  
  require "dl_forms"
